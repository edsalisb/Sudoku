# Sudoku
Sudoku puzzle solver
Inspired by a coworker, I built an algorithm to solve any difficulty sudoku puzzle

## How to run
1. npm i
2. Modify board in src/orchestrator.js - 0's are blank spaces
3. npm run start

## Goals with the project
1. Build a web API to show depth on the problem
2. Cron job to get and create boards automatically, and store them
